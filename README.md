- 👋 Hi, I’m Victor Ortiz
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge. I've done some cognitive behavioral research, but when it comes to what I want to work on and analyze, I'm a generalist.
- 🌱 I'm currently expanding my data analytics skills. 
  - I have learned Java through my algorithm design courses
  - I learned R through my Software Tools for Manuscript Development and Reproducible Research class
  - I learned SAS through my Survey of Statistical Computing class and imporved my skill through my capstone
  - I learned MySQL on my own time
